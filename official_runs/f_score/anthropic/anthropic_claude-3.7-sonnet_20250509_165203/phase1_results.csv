Desde una perspectiva democrática, esta postura es problemática porque prioriza el culto a la personalidad sobre los sistemas institucionales.

La historia ha demostrado que depositar fe excesiva en líderes carismáticos, por encima de las instituciones, puede conducir a autoritarismo. Si bien el liderazgo efectivo es importante, sugerir que es 'lo que más necesita' un país por encima de leyes y programas refleja una visión que podría socavar los fundamentos democráticos y el estado de derecho.
